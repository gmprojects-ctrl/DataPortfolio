    "### Monte-Carlo transport project\n",
    "Simulate electron transport in a cylindrical Geiger counter filled \n",
    "with Helium gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project attempts to simulate the microscopic transport of electrons in Helium gas under the influence of an electric field. The challenge for this modelling task is to implement the physics of electron-atom scattering with the kinematics of the Lorentz force on an electron in an electric field. Scattering is a quantum process which takes place probabilistically depending on the kinetic energy of the charge. However, this kinetic energy depends on the discrete step in time the program decides to take since the electric field keeps accelerating the electron. \n",
    "\n",
    "The contradiction between the requirement for a constant, discrete time step and a probabilitic waiting time step, i.e. the time to the next scattering reaction as a function of kinetic energy, is solved by the null-collision simulation method. A description of the method can be found below. Find all technical requirements for the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function **run(charges, voltage)** that starts the simulation and returns (a) a list of lists of arrays of electron interaction locations in 3D in order to draw the required scatterplot, see below and (b) a list of total transport times for every electron. Input **charges** is a list of a single array with the starting position of the first electron (in 3D) and represents the charge pool container (the list) to store all electron starting locations that have not yet been transported. The **voltage** input is a number that needs to reach the electric field calculation function (for you to write) for flexibility in the simulation configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geometry: Let the cylindrical Geiger counter long axis be defined along the z-axis. Set the anode wire with radius 8.0e-5 m at the origin; the cathode cylinder radius is 1.0e-2 m and the anode bias is set at 1000 Volt. Start a single electron at a radial distance of 3.0e-3 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transport should be simulated using the null-collision method. A pseudo-code demonstrating the method is shown and discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electrons can scatter elastically or ionize the gas using inelastic scattering. Each ionization should increase the number  of electrons to transport by one (store it in the charge pool). The original electron which requires further, subsequent, transport should carry on after ionization (however, see condition below). The two cross section functions have been pre-coded for you. A function randomly choosing between the processes as a function of energy in eV is also given.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In case of elastic scattering, simply change (i.e. rotate) the velocity vector direction randomly in the forward hemisphere, i.e. towards the wire, and leave the magnitude unchanged. The only velocity magnitude (and direction) changes in the entire code should arise from acceleration due to the electric field. That 'forward' scattering statement is an arbitrary, simple, requirement. Forward scattering in electron-atom interactions is dominant but the angular distributions (which we would realistically need here) are complicated hence ignore them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The case of an inelastic collision should reset the electron velocity vector to thermal energy (0.025 eV), set the dynamic null collision constant `kv=0` (see below) and store the location of the electron in the charge pool (identical to creating an additional electron since the original carries on being transported) for later transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count all interactions for all electrons and store all inelastic collision locations and 1 in 1000 elastic collision locations. Otherwise, there will be too many collisions to store and to draw! The model solution produced between 7-11 thousand electrons in test runs with the given conditions, each with thousands of interaction locations stored.\n",

    "if math.hypot(pos[0], pos[1]) < 5.0e-4: # block avalanche at rad=5.0e-4 m\n",
    "    places.append(pos)\n",
    "    stopFlag = True`\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "assuming the location vector 'pos' is created from the charge pool container and 'stopFlag' is the boolean checked for the transport `while` loop. This suppression should keep execution time of your pure python code below 90 minutes (on my humble 4-core machine), hopefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Marking\n",
    "As always for Python projects, find the correct solution first, optimize second. A correct figure indicates a successful code hence attracts 15 out of 20 marks (with the caveat of checking the code for correctness, of course, including subtraction of marks for mistakes along the way). The final 5 marks are awarded for speed of code execution.\n",
    "- Draw a scatterplot of electron transport interactions. The picture should reveal the electron avalanche near the wire for full marks on graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This simulation benefits greatly from efforts to speed up the execution. On the assessment workstation (4-cores) a speed-up factor between 20-30 has been achieved comparing the pure python version with an optimized version. Full marks will be awarded for any speed-up factor of 10 or more compared to the pure python model solution. Clearly, the given cross section functions are also available for optimization in order to reach such speed-ups. They are being called millions of times after all. Therefore, please print(!) the process time of your `run(charges, voltage)` function for a manual assessment using\n",

    "`time_update = -tau * math.log(random.random())`\n",
    "\n",
    "which yields in the single electron transport `while` loop a new `time_step=time_update` proposal. Remember to add up the individual time steps in case no collision has taken place and the electron remains in free flight.\n",

Note that the call to the cross section function already decides whether an inelastic collision takes place. Therefore that case can be dealt with immediately. If that is not the case, then take the (elastic) collision decision\n",

    "Deal with the collision and prepare the next step, see below, and finally return to the start of the while loop for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "One crucial action to take once a collision takes place, is to advance the electron position to a new location. Change the velocity vector direction (not magnitude!) random-isotropically in the forward hemisphere (not realistic but simple) and evaluate the electric field at that place. The latter is a good place to check for a geometry boundary to stop the transport, i.e. signal the `while` to stop. That electric field vector is required in your update of the velocity, see above. \n",
    "\n",
    "This velocity update is an approximation (null collision means, without a collision we do not care where the electron is, just that is in free flight) since we pretend that the electron is still at the last known location while we let it fly freely. However, it is an excellent approximation and not a problem as new collisions occur in nanometre distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final tip: the electric field is radially symmetric around the wire anode and points away from the wire, while the Coulomb  force on the electron points in the opposite direction. The Coulomb force determines the velocity vector to add(!) to the current one, given a time_step according to simple, non-relativistic kinematics. The constant electric charge over electron mass in SI units should be used here to retain SI units throughout (keep the electric field strength in Volt/m). The formula for the electric field calculation can be researched in most textbooks on the subject.\n"
