# DataPortfolio
Portfolio showing my work using Python/C during my Mathematics degree at the University of Warwick.
In detail, there are three folders

1.) PX281 Computational Physics. **Assignment 6, projectPDM** is of particular interest as it demonstrate clear data analysis skills

2.) PX390 Scientific Programming demonstrates aptitude in C. **Assignment 4 and Assignment 5** demonstrates my capacity to model.
 
3.) MA250 Introduction to Partial Differential Equations demonstrates ability model further. **Assignment 4** demonstrates this specifically.

All questions are reserved to the University of Warwick Mathematical Institute.
